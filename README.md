Note: This instruction set is just a copy-paste from Marie, note that [乇乃尺凵工丂乇尺](https://t.me/ebruiser) aims to handle support for @ebruiser_bot and not how to set up your own fork. If you find this bit confusing/tough to understand then we recommend you ask a dev, kindly avoid asking how to set up the bot instance in the support chat, it aims to help our own instance of the bot and not the forks.

  ## Setting up the bot (Read this before trying to use!):
Please make sure to use python3.6, as I cannot guarantee everything will work as expected on older Python versions!
This is because markdown parsing is done by iterating through a dict, which is ordered by default in 3.6.


A modular Telegram Python bot running on python3 with a sqlalchemy database.

Originally a Marie fork, Ebruiser evolved further and was built to be more robust . for Controlling Spammers , we have added **Spamwatch** in Global Bans.
